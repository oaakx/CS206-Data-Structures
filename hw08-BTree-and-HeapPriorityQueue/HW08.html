<div class="eb-markdown material-exercise-readme-content"><h2>Homework 8</h2>
<h3>Part 1. BTree (IntBalancedSet.java)</h3>
<p>In this homework, you are required to implement a class, IntBalancedSet, which is a set of integers stored in a B-tree. A skeleton file for the class is provided in elice system. Implement the B-tree methods based on the skeleton code and descriptions in the class.</p>
<p>You must implement all methods except “print” and “private helper methods”. Implementation of private helper methods is up to you. Only four mandatory functions (add, clone, contains, remove) and change/status of instance variables will be graded. However, we highly recommend you to implement every private helper method as explained in the text book. If you want to know more about how each method should work, the chapter for B-tree in the text book (Section 10.2) will be a good source for your information.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Private helper methods are all methods below the annotation “// PRIVATE HELPER METHODS” in the skeleton code, including transferRight and transferLeft.</strong></p>
<p>**NOTE: All mandatory methods should work as described in the text book. Read 556p~577p of text book for more information. The claims caused by the difference from the text book may not be allowed.
**</p>
<p>**NOTE: You must not copy others’ implementation of private helper methods, as well as mandatory methods.
**
**NOTE: Please do not change MINIMUM, MAXIMUM.
**</p>
<h3>Part 2. Priority Queue with Heap (HeapPQ.java)</h3>
<p>The second part of the homework is to solve the problem 1 in ‘programming projects’(pg 594). Please read the problem carefully and implement ‘add()’ and ‘remove()’ methods in the skeleton code that we provide. The requirements of the methods are same as descriptions in ‘figure 7.12’.</p>
<h4>parameter explanation</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>priorities</em> : stores a priority of each node</li>
<li><em>data</em> : stores data of each node</li>
<li><em>entered</em> : stores the order of entrance of each node</li>
</ul>
<p>**NOTE : Do not empty the first element of the arrays. Please follow the lecture ppt. **
<strong>NOTE : Please do not modify the ‘priorities’, ‘data’, ‘entered’ parameters’ names, and the methods that has a comment that it will be used in the test.</strong>
<strong>NOTE : Please be aware of the FIFO characteristic that described in the problem.</strong></p>
