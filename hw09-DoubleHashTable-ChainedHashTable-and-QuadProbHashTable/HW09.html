<p>In this homework, you need to implement the double hashing table(<em>DHTable</em>), chained hashing table(<em>CHTable</em>), and quadratic probing table(<em>QPTable</em>) classes. They all have same method with same function. However, their algorithm is different. DHTable uses double hashing to find address, CHTable uses chained hashing and QPTable uses quadratic probing.</p>
<p>For more detail, please read the document.</p>
<p><strong>Please donâ€™t erase <em>visits</em> variable. We use this method for testing. And also update this variable correctly to get good score.</strong></p>
