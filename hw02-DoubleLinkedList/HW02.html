<div class="eb-markdown material-exercise-readme-content"><p>You have to make DoubleLinkedSeq class and fill out the empty methods.</p>
<p>What you have to implement is all in the textbook. Please see FIGURE 4.18 in the textbook.</p>
<p>Basically, you have to implement all the methods in the book. In addition, you have to implement two more methods.</p>
<p>Please fill out the methods in DoubleLinkedSeq.java file.</p>
<p>Also you should implement two addional methods, removeNegative and removeMostDuplicate.</p>
<hr>
<h2>public void removeNegative()</h2>
<p>It removes negative elements from a sequence. The order of remained sequence is same as the order of the input sequence. Set cursor to new head.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>[8 20 -3 48 12 -1] -&gt; [8 20 48 12]</p>
<p>Precondition</p>
<p>The number of elements is larger than 1.</p>
<hr>
<h2>public void removeMostDuplicate()</h2>
<p>It removes elements whose number is duplicated the most times. If there is no unique number which is duplicated the most times, it removes nothing. The order of remained sequence is same as the order of the input sequence. Set cursor to new head.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>[-1 1 -1 2 4 2 -1 10 -13] -&gt; [1 2 3 2 10 -13]</p>
<p>[-1 1 -1 2 4 2] -&gt; [-1 1 -1 2 4 2]</p>
<p>Precondition</p>
<p>The number of elements is larger than 1.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>I implemented private boolean isEqual(double a, double b). Please use the isEqual method to compare two double variables. Because double variable comparison has an issue of bit calculation.</p>
