<p>In homework 4, you are required to implement a simple calculator called StackCalculator using LinkedStack.
StackCalculator receives an infix arithmetic expression and returns the result of the expression.
The calculation is done by two steps, changing infix expression to postfix expression (<strong>changeToPostfix</strong>), and evaluating postfix expression to achieve the result (<strong>evaluate</strong>).</p>
<p>To simplify the problem, we set some limitations (rules) on StackCalculator.</p>
<ol>
<li>StackCalculator only deals with four basic operators, *<em>+, -, <em>, /</em></em> and three kinds of brackets, which are <strong>(, ), {,}, [,]</strong>. The operation order is described as below.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>*, / -&gt; +,-
<ul>
<li>Multiplication and division should be operated before addition and subtraction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>() -&gt; {} -&gt; []
<ul>
<li>Equations in parentheses should be calculated before equations in curly brackets.</li>
<li>Equations in curly brackets should be calculated before equations in square brackets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>StackCalculator can receive the input expression consists of the operators, three kinds of brackets, and any real number. Each component will be separated with a space, e.g. “3.25 * 12 – 8 + -7”. The components of converted postfix expression should be separated with a space too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StackCalculator cannot divide the number by zero. Therefore, if such expression (input or intermediate) is given, StackCalculator throws the DividedByZeroException.
StackCalculator cannot calculate the input expression with unbalanced parenthesis. Therefore, if such expression is given, StackCalculator throws the UnbalancedParenthesisException.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>StackCalculator utilizes LinkedStack, not java.util.Stack.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The claims caused by the problem that is out of the limitations (rules) will not be allowed.</p>
<p>Submit the implementation of the StackCalculator class through Elice system.
You have to implement two methods (<strong>changeToPostfix and evaluate</strong>) in <strong>StackCalculator.java</strong> file in the Elice system.
Please <strong>do not change</strong> the parameters, modifiers, and exceptions in the method.</p>
<p>For your information, Figure 6.10 (p. 379) and Figure 6.8 (p. 375) will be a help to you.</p>
